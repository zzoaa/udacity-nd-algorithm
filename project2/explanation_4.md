## Why did you use that data structure?

I apply GroupTable with python dict.
Then the GroupTable was using the global variable. 
So, It is made easily to check that the user is in the group.

## the efficiency (time and space) of your solution.

Adding users is O(1) of time complexity.
Adding groups is O(1) of time complexity.

Checking the user is in the group is O(1) of time complexity.

Group is O(N) of space complexity.
